## Feature Breakdown

### Core Module Tasks

1. **MathElement**: Basic wrapper for any hashable value
2. **MathSet**: Immutable set with optional NumPy integration
3. **MathRelation**: Binary relations between sets
4. **MathFunction**: Type-safe mathematical functions
5. **MathStructure**: Generic structure with operations and relations
6. **ProbabilityDistribution**: Specialized for probabilistic computations

### Development Principles

#### Small, Focused Changes

- One dataclass per PR/commit
- Single algorithm implementations
- Incremental feature additions
- Focused bug fixes only

#### Testing Strategy

- Property-based testing for mathematical laws
- Example-based tests for specific algorithms
- Performance benchmarks for numerical code
- Type safety verification with mypy

#### Code Quality Gates

- [ ] All functions have NumPy-style docstrings
- [ ] Type annotations on all public APIs
- [ ] No circular imports between modules
- [ ] Ruff formatting and linting passes
- [ ] MyPy strict mode without errors

## Current Sprint Planning

### Sprint 1: Core Types (1 week)

**Focus**: Basic mathematical structures

**Tasks**:

1. Implement `MathElement` with tests
2. Implement `MathSet` with frozen set semantics
3. Add NumPy array integration to `MathSet`
4. Write property-based tests for set operations
5. Document usage patterns with examples

### Sprint 2: Core Operations (1 week)

**Focus**: Pure functions for mathematical operations

**Tasks**:

1. Implement set operations (union, intersection, difference)
2. Implement `MathRelation` and relation operations
3. Implement `MathFunction` with composition
4. Add type protocols for extensibility
5. Performance testing and optimization

### Sprint 3: Graph Theory Foundation (1 week)

**Focus**: Graph structures and basic algorithms

**Tasks**:

1. Design graph dataclasses extending core types
2. Implement adjacency representations
3. Basic traversal algorithms (BFS, DFS)
4. Graph property calculations (degree, diameter)
5. Integration tests with core module

## Risk Management

### Technical Risks

- **NumPy integration complexity**: Mitigate with incremental integration
- **Performance vs abstraction trade-offs**: Benchmark early and often
- **Circular dependencies**: Enforce module boundaries with tests

### Scope Risks

- **Feature creep**: Stick to mathematical correctness over completeness
- **Over-engineering**: Prefer simple solutions, add complexity only when needed
- **Tool chain complexity**: Standardize on Ruff + MyPy, avoid tool proliferation

## Success Metrics

### Code Quality

- Type coverage >95%
- Zero Ruff violations
- All tests passing
- Documentation coverage >90%

### Mathematical Correctness

- Property-based tests validate theoretical properties
- Numerical algorithms handle edge cases correctly
- Results match reference implementations where applicable

### Developer Experience

- Clear, discoverable APIs
- Minimal boilerplate for common operations
- Good error messages and type hints
- Examples work without modification

## Next Actions

1. **Immediate**: Implement `MathElement` and `MathSet` in `core/types.py`
2. **This Week**: Complete core mathematical structures
3. **Next Week**: Begin graph theory implementation
4. **Month Goal**: Have working graph algorithms with visualization

## Dependencies & Blockers
